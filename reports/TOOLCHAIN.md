# Toolchain

Recorded 2026-09-23 on aarch64-apple-darwin. Pins match
`cose-parse-nopanic/reports/TOOLCHAIN.md` (this crate's own layout template)
exactly, since both repositories share the one Charon/Aeneas/Lean checkout on
this machine.

| Component | Pin | What ran here |
|---|---|---|
| Charon | commit `909ff09a`, v0.1.220 (`--preset=aeneas`) | `/Users/dzatona/charon` @ `909ff09ad0f144f83d354f2c3d26f631fb9f8e9a`, crate version `0.1.220` |
| Charon rustc | nightly-2026-06-01 (Charon's `rust-toolchain`) | same |
| Aeneas | commit `c2015b86` | `/Users/dzatona/aeneas` @ `c2015b86` (`Add bitwise operators on booleans. (#967)`); `charon-pin` matches `909ff09a` |
| Lean / mathlib | v4.31.0 | `leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0` (elan); mathlib4 `v4.31.0` via Aeneas `lakefile.lean` |
| rustc (crate tests) | stable, local `1.95.0` (`59807616e 2026-04-14`) | crate `rust-version = "1.92"` |

No deviation from the `cose-parse-nopanic` pins was needed or recorded.

## Install (this machine)

Identical to `cose-parse-nopanic/reports/TOOLCHAIN.md`; both repositories
use the one `~/charon` and `~/aeneas` checkout, so this is not reinstalled
per repository.

```sh
# Charon
git clone https://github.com/AeneasVerif/charon.git ~/charon
cd ~/charon && git checkout 909ff09ad0f144f83d354f2c3d26f631fb9f8e9a
rustup component add --toolchain nightly-2026-06-01-aarch64-apple-darwin rustfmt
make build-charon-rust   # produces ~/charon/bin/charon

# Aeneas (OCaml 5.3.0)

ln -sfn ~/charon ~/aeneas/charon
# after cloning Aeneas @ c2015b86:
gmake -C ~/aeneas build   # GNU make; BSD make 3.81 is rejected

# Lean
brew install elan-init
elan toolchain install leanprover/lean4:v4.31.0
cd ~/aeneas/backends/lean && lake exe cache get && lake build Aeneas
```

`lean/lakefile.lean` loads Aeneas from `$HOME/aeneas/backends/lean`
(`AENEAS_LEAN` overrides).

## `scripts/check-extraction.sh` requirements

Additionally needs `python3` on `PATH` (standard on macOS and on the Ubuntu
CI image; used only to compare two LLBC JSON files while ignoring two fields
that are not reproducible across Charon runs — see the comment in
`scripts/check-extraction.sh` and `reports/EXTRACT.md` for what those two
fields are and why ignoring them does not weaken the check).

## Why `lean/lake-manifest.json` is not committed

`.gitignore` excludes `/lean/lake-manifest.json` deliberately, not by
oversight. `lean/lakefile.lean` depends on Aeneas as a `path`-type
dependency (`require aeneas from aeneasLean`, resolved from `$AENEAS_LEAN`
or `$HOME/aeneas/backends/lean`), and Lake's manifest records that
dependency's resolved location as a literal absolute path — on this
machine, `"dir": "/Users/dzatona/aeneas/backends/lean"`. Committing that
file would either be wrong on every other machine (a stale absolute path
that doesn't exist there) or, on CI, wrong in the opposite way (CI's own
`lake build` regenerates the manifest pointing at `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`,
which would immediately diverge from whatever was committed, defeating
the point of committing it). There is no portable, machine-independent
form of this manifest as long as Aeneas is a local `path` dependency
rather than a pinned `git` one.

The authoritative pin is not the manifest; it is `AeneasVerif/aeneas` at
commit `c2015b86`, recorded in this file's table above and pinned
explicitly in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s "Checkout Aeneas c2015b86"
step (`git fetch --depth 1 origin c2015b8668ba6d5b41f5f19d00a881c12bbb0b5d`
then `git checkout FETCH_HEAD`) — not derived from any manifest, local or
committed. `mathlib`/`plausible`/`batteries`/etc. are pinned transitively
through Aeneas's own `lakefile.lean` at that commit, which *is* committed,
in the Aeneas repository, not this one.
